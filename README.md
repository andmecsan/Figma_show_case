# What's new in Figma Dev Mode? 

I prepare this little repo to test the github extension of the new 💫**Dev Mode**💫 We are going to 🏊 into some interesting things, let's go!

## Github Extension 🐱‍💻

Let's start with the new Gihub extension, there is a new plugin that connects **Figma with Github**, but how it works?

You can 🔗 a PR link to a component inside Figma, so inside Figma we can consult the status of the PR. What are my thoughts about this? I think it's a great way for the designer and product team to see the status of the development of a component, but from a developer's point of view it may not be our query flow, since we usually go directly to the PR to check it without going through Figma 🎨 first.


## Open in Visual Studio Tool 🛠️

Next it's the VS tool, supposedly we can open the design inside VS to check directly the designs and navigate between them in another tab right next to our code, how cool it's that! But it's a shame that it's not working right now because of this [bug](https://forum.figma.com/t/vscode-extension-not-working/45724), beta effect 🧪😶

## And inside Figma? 🎨🤔
Pretty cool new things! 

First the new **Ready for development section 🎁**, the designer can mark now the sections/components that are ready for development as the name suggest, great to be aware of what are the finished designs in earliers steps of the product 👶

The new **Inspect Section**, now from the developer perspective it's much easier to see in code the css styles and layout of a component, also they added a more visual way to see the structure of the padding,. margin and border of a component. They also allow to create variable so for example we can see in Figma if the margin of a component its a s24 or a s8 directly, much easier! 😭✨

## Amazing stuff...right? 👀

What are our thoughts? 🧠 I think that all these new features can help us to give a greater use to Figma than we give it as developers 🤓, we can start to implement the use of these new tools to have more present the design in the development process, but let's open the debate 🍈. Thank you! 🤗
